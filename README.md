## What Are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are snippets of JavaScript code saved as browser bookmarks. When clicked, they execute the JavaScript code on the current webpage. They are lightweight, portable, and do not require installation or extensions. Bookmarklets are a great way to add custom functionality to any website without modifying its source code.
